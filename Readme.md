# Progressive Web Apps (PWA)
Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) were introduced by Google in 2015 as a set of features that enable web pages to function and interact like native apps. PWAs bridge the gap between websites and mobile applications, providing the best of both worlds.

## Disadvantages of Native Apps

1. **Dual Codebase Maintenance**
   - Maintaining both a web version and an Android version increases development costs and effort.

2. **Discoverability Issues**
   - Native apps have lower discoverability on app stores compared to web versions.

3. **No SEO for App Stores**
   - Apps in app stores cannot leverage Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to attract organic traffic.

4. **Installation Requirement**
   - Apps must be downloaded and installed, whereas websites can be accessed instantly via a browser.

## Disadvantages of Websites

1. **Session Persistence**
   - Websites may be lost if the browser tab is accidentally closed, unlike apps that remain installed on the device.

2. **Loyalty and Accessibility**
   - Users tend to be more loyal to apps as they are more accessible, residing on the home screen.

3. **Offline Support**
   - Websites traditionally lack offline support, reducing usability in areas with poor connectivity.

4. **Push Notifications**
   - Websites cannot natively support push notifications, limiting user re-engagement opportunities.

## Advantages / Features of PWAs

1. **Offline Availability**
   - PWAs work seamlessly without an active internet connection, enhancing user experience.

2. **SEO-Friendly**
   - PWAs are indexed by search engines, improving visibility and discoverability compared to native apps.

3. **App-Like Experience**
   - PWAs provide a responsive and immersive user experience similar to native apps.

4. **Push Notifications**
   - PWAs support push notifications, enabling businesses to re-engage users effectively.

5. **Background Synchronization**
   - PWAs can perform background sync to ensure data consistency and updates. For example, in WhatsApp, if you send a message while offline, the app queues the message and automatically sends it once the network is available.


6. **Add to Home Screen**
   - Users can easily add PWAs to their home screens without visiting an app store.

7. **Customizable Splash Screens**
   - PWAs support customized splash screens, offering a more polished and branded experience.

8. **Access to Device APIs**
   - PWAs can access device APIs, providing enhanced functionality and a richer user experience. Examples include accessing the camera, geolocation, Bluetooth, and more, allowing PWAs to deliver app-like capabilities directly through the browser.



## Conclusion

PWAs combine the advantages of both websites and native apps, making them a versatile solution for modern web applications. By addressing the limitations of traditional apps and websites, PWAs offer a cost-effective and engaging experience for users.
